# GUIQuizCode
I am making a compatibility quiz that I am now trying to add a GUI and inheritance into. 
I will upload the original code separately even though it didn't work.
Logically I should have fixed the original code before creating, a more complicated system. 
Though this seems more complicated, the basic parts that were in the first program are greatly improved in the new program. 
Along with the GUI and inheritance I also am attempting to add an expandable file system. 
I would very much like to figure out how JFrames and GUIs work in this context, but for the time being I am just gonna keep trying things.
If anyone sees this and knows whats wrong with my GUI let me know, thank you.
